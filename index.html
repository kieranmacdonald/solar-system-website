                <h3>Orbit</h3>
                <p>Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.</p>

                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Name origin</h3>
                <p>The name "Earth" is derived from both English and German words, 'eor(th)e/ertha' and 'erde', respectively, which mean ground. Earth is the only planet that wasn't named after a Greek or Roman god or goddess.</p>

                <h3>Orbit</h3>
                <p>Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.</p>

                <h3>Name origin</h3>

                <h3>Orbit</h3>
                <p>The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar.</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                <p>The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3>Name origin</h3>
                <p>The name of Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter).</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                <p>In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet.</p>

                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Name origin</h3>
                <p>It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol &#9798;, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                <p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.</p>
